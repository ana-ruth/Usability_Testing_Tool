# Usability Testing Tool

## 📘 Overview

- **Consent Tab:** Displays consent terms and records digital agreement.  
- **Demographics Tab:** Collects participants’ name, age, occupation, area of study, and familiarity with usability tools.  
- **Task Tab:** Allows participants to complete assigned tasks, track completion time, success rate, and add observer notes.  
- **Exit Questionnaire Tab:** Gathers user satisfaction, difficulty ratings, and open-ended feedback using sliders and text fields.  
- **Report Tab:** Summarizes and visualizes collected data through tables and Matplotlib charts (age group distribution, familiarity breakdown, and task completion statistics).
